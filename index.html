    <h2>What is a Brain Aneurysm?</h2>
    <p>A brain aneurysm is a bulge or ballooning in a blood vessel in the brain that can leak or rupture, causing bleeding into the brain (hemorrhagic stroke). It can develop without symptoms and become life-threatening if it ruptures.</p>

    <h2>My Personal Experience</h2>
    <p>
      After being taken to the emergency room, doctors performed a CAT scan that was negative. Due to my symptoms, the doctor suspected possible meningitis. Upon family consent to perform a spinal tap, he discovered blood and immediately knew I was bleeding on the brain.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a result, I was transported to a larger, more equipped facility. Upon arrival, I was immediately taken for an angiogram which showed a blurry image of uncertainty. Days later, a second scan was much clearer and showed the bleed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The following morning, I underwent an 8+ hour brain surgery called a craniotomy to insert an aneurysm clip to secure the area.
